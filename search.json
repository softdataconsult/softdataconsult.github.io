    "title": "Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nPartial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) is a statistical approach used to estimate complex cause-effect relationship models involving latent constructs and their indicators. It’s widely used in fields like marketing, management, psychology, and social sciences, particularly when traditional covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM) assumptions are too restrictive or the data do not meet normality or sample size requirements.\n\nKey Concepts in PLS-SEM\n\nLatent Variables (LVs): Latent variables are unobserved variables that are inferred from multiple observed indicators. In PLS-SEM, these are often theoretical constructs like “Customer Satisfaction” or “Brand Loyalty.” LVs are measured indirectly via observed variables, called indicators.\nIndicators: These are the observed variables or items (such as survey questions or measurable attributes) used to measure the latent variables. For instance, “Customer Satisfaction” could be measured using a set of questions where each question represents an indicator.\nMeasurement Model (Outer Model): This part of the model defines the relationship between the latent variables and their respective indicators. There are two types of measurement models:\n\nReflective Measurement Model: Indicators are caused by the latent variable (e.g., “Customer Satisfaction” causes the survey responses).\nFormative Measurement Model: Indicators form or define the latent variable (e.g., “Income” and “Education” collectively form “Socioeconomic Status”).\n\nStructural Model (Inner Model): This represents the relationships between latent variables, defining the hypothesized paths and cause-effect relationships in the model. For example, “Customer Satisfaction” might influence “Customer Loyalty.”\nPath Coefficients: These are the estimates of the relationships between latent variables in the structural model. They indicate the strength and direction of the relationships (similar to regression coefficients).\nWeights and Loadings:\n\nWeights are used to calculate latent variable scores from their indicators (especially in formative models).\nLoadings represent the strength of the relationship between indicators and latent variables in reflective models.\n\nR-squared: This is the measure of explained variance for the endogenous latent variables (dependent variables) in the model. It indicates how much variance in the latent variable is explained by the independent variables.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to Use PLS-SEM\nPLS-SEM is used when:\n\nThe model is complex with many latent variables and indicators.\nThe data do not meet the assumptions of normality or large sample size.\nThe goal is prediction or theory development (as opposed to theory confirmation).\nFormative constructs (where indicators form a latent variable) are present.\nThe model includes relationships that might not converge in CB-SEM.\n\nPLS-SEM is particularly useful when dealing with smaller samples, non-normal data, and exploratory research scenarios.\n\n\nAdvantages of PLS-SEM\n\nFlexibility: PLS-SEM can handle both reflective and formative constructs, and it doesn’t require strict distributional assumptions (i.e., no normality assumption).\nSmall Sample Size: PLS-SEM performs well with small to medium sample sizes, unlike CB-SEM, which requires larger samples.\nComplex Models: It is suited for models with a large number of constructs and relationships (even when these models may not converge using CB-SEM).\nFocus on Prediction: PLS-SEM is more concerned with maximizing the explained variance (prediction) of dependent variables rather than testing the fit of the entire model.\nBootstrapping for Significance: PLS-SEM uses bootstrapping techniques to generate standard errors and confidence intervals, allowing for hypothesis testing without relying on traditional parametric assumptions.\n\n\n\nSteps in PLS-SEM\n\nModel Specification: Specify the measurement model (linking latent variables and indicators) and the structural model (linking latent variables to each other).\nModel Estimation: PLS-SEM iteratively estimates relationships by maximizing the variance explained in the dependent latent variables. It first estimates the latent variable scores, then calculates the path coefficients.\nModel Evaluation: Evaluate the measurement model (using indicator reliability, internal consistency, and convergent validity) and the structural model (using path coefficients, R-squared, and predictive relevance).\nBootstrapping: This is used to estimate the precision of the PLS estimates and to assess the significance of the path coefficients (p-values) in the structural model.\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation Criteria\n\nMeasurement Model:\n\nReliability: Evaluated using indicator loadings and composite reliability.\nValidity: Checked with average variance extracted (AVE), discriminant validity (HTMT or Fornell-Larcker criterion).\nCollinearity: VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to ensure no multicollinearity in formative constructs.\n\nStructural Model:\n\nPath Coefficients: The strength and significance of relationships between latent variables.\nR-squared (R²): Indicates the variance explained by independent latent variables for each endogenous latent variable.\nPredictive Relevance (Q²): Assessed using blindfolding procedures to determine how well the model can predict.\n\nGoodness of Fit: Although traditional SEM focuses on model fit indices (like chi-square, RMSEA, etc.), PLS-SEM focuses more on the variance explained (R²) and predictive power rather than overall model fit.\n\n\n\nCommon Software for PLS-SEM\n\nSmartPLS: A popular commercial software with a graphical user interface.\nADANCO: Another commercial software specifically designed for PLS-SEM.\nR: Free and flexible tools like plspm, semPLS, and seminr.\nWarpPLS: A commercial tool that offers unique algorithms for PLS-SEM.\n\n\n\nPLS-SEM vs. Covariance-Based SEM (CB-SEM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nPLS-SEM\nCB-SEM (e.g., LISREL, AMOS)\n\n\n\n\nGoal\nPrediction, theory development\nTheory confirmation\n\n\nSample Size\nSmall to medium\nLarge\n\n\nAssumptions\nNon-parametric, no normality required\nParametric, requires normality\n\n\nModel Fit\nFocuses on R² and predictive power\nFit indices (e.g., RMSEA, CFI, etc.)\n\n\nHandling Complexity\nHandles complex models easily\nMay struggle with large, complex models\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications of PLS-SEM\n\nMarketing: Used for customer satisfaction and loyalty models.\nSocial Sciences: To explore relationships between behavioral constructs.\nBusiness: For evaluating business performance and strategy.\nInformation Systems: For studying technology acceptance models (e.g., TAM).\n\n\n\nConclusion\nPLS-SEM is a powerful and flexible method used to estimate complex models with latent variables and their indicators. It is especially suited for exploratory research and predictive modeling, offering an alternative to traditional covariance-based SEM when data and model conditions are not ideal."
